<h2 class="h2a">Describe the business value of Power Platform</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Microsoft Power Platform is a collection of tools that are designed to simplify the process of gathering, processing, and reporting company data. Although the Power Platform tools are suitable for professional development efforts—and Microsoft uses them to build their own Dynamics 365 and Office 365 extensibility functions—they require little or no coding and are intended for use by people with no formal software development training or experience, whom Microsoft refers to as <em>citizen developers</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">The main Power Platform tools, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig1">Figure 1-1</a>, are designed to provide users with the ability to perform three key actions on their data: analyze, act, and automate. The tools that perform these actions are as follows:</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3"></span>Analyze data using Power BI</h4>
<p class="noindent">Businesses are frequently inundated with data from many sources and in many formats, often more than users can easily access, interpret, and assimilate. Data in its raw form—basically tables or lists of numbers—can be difficult for large groups to understand and use effectively. This is why it has long been a common practice for businesses to convert numerical data into charts and graphs. Users can see at a glance the relationships between values in a chart that would be much more obscure in numerical form.</p>
<p class="indent">An individual user can easily transform the data in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet into a chart and share it with other users, but when the data changes, the spreadsheet and chart must be updated and redistributed. In addition, today’s business environments also frequently store large amounts of data in a variety of locations and media formats, not just spreadsheets maintained by a single user.</p>
<p class="indent">Power BI is a tool that can access data from multiple sources, transform it into a variety of graphical formats, and publish the results in a cloud-based service that users can access from any location, using virtually any device.</p>
<p class="indent">Power BI allows users to access and view their data in ways that are more intuitive and convenient than traditional tables and lists of numbers. Graphs and charts can provide an immediate impression of the data’s current values, as opposed to a detailed examination of the numbers that can take much more time and expertise to interpret. In addition, the Power BI user interface can allow users to interact with their data, such as by displaying additional information when they click a data point.</p>
<p class="indent">Power BI is a tool that consists of services, applications, and connectors that can access data from multiple sources and display it in various ways. Power BI does not manipulate or modify the data in any way. Whether a user is a designer using Power BI Desktop to model data or a consumer using the Power BI reading view to display the published data, nothing that either type of user does can possibly modify or delete the underlying data itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Power BI consists of two main components:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Power BI service</em>—A cloud service that provides Power BI’s consumer functions by allowing users to access the content that designers have created</p></li>
<li><p class="squareb"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Power BI Desktop</em>—A Windows application that designers use to gather data; transform that data by creating dashboards, reports, and apps; and publish it to the Power BI service</p></li>
</ul>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec1">Consuming Power BI Content</h5>
<p class="noindent">The object of Power BI is to consolidate data from multiple sources and present it in a more visually compelling manner, using graphical elements such as charts and graphs. The Power BI service is the consumer end of the tool, which runs in the cloud and allows users to access the data published by designers. Power BI visuals are accessible from the cloud using any web browser or a mobile device, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig2">Figure 1-2</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig2">
<img src="images/01fig02.jpg" alt="Power BI service content displayed on a smartphone, in a desktop browser, and on a tablet"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-2</strong> Visuals published in the Power BI service displayed in browsers and mobile devices</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"></span>After a designer connects to a data source, creates Power BI content, and publishes it to the service, the connection to the source remains in place and the published data is updated automatically as the source data changes. Users can thus track information on a continual basis.</p>
<p class="indent">As with many of Microsoft’s cloud-based interfaces, the Power BI service displays are composed of multiple tiles. The Power BI home page, shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig3">Figure 1-3</a>, contains tiles representing the user’s favorites and recently accessed elements by default, as well as a navigation menu on the left.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig3">
<img src="images/01fig03.jpg" alt="A Power BI home page containing a navigation menu bar on the left and a collection of tiles in groups representing the user’s favorites and recently accessed elements"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-3</strong> The Power BI home page</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Using combinations of tiles, the Power BI service can display data in three basic formats: dashboards, reports, and apps, as described in the following sections.</p>
<section>
<h6 class="h6" id="ch1lev4sec1">Using Dashboards</h6>
<p class="noindent">The most basic type of display in the Power BI interface is the <em>dashboard</em>. A dashboard (sometimes called a <em>canvas</em>) is a one-page view, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig4">Figure 1-4</a>, containing tiles drawn from one or more reports that tells a single story.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig4">
<img src="images/01fig04.jpg" alt="A sample Power BI dashboard with eight tiles containing various line, bar, and pie graphs illustrating data on active employees and new hires"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-4</strong> A Power BI dashboard displaying basic human resources information for a firm</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"></span>After a dashboard is published in the Power BI service, consumers can interact with it in a variety of ways. For example, clicking a tile opens the report from which the tile was taken. Hovering the cursor over an element of a graph, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig5">Figure 1-5</a>, displays the actual data value represented.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig5">
<img src="images/01fig05.jpg" alt="A bar graph from a Power BI dashboard with the value of a single data point displayed in a pop-up window"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-5</strong> A bar graph from a Power BI dashboard with the value of a single data point displayed</p></figcaption>
</figure>
</section>
<section>
<h6 class="h6" id="ch1lev4sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"></span>Using Reports</h6>
<p class="noindent">A <em>report</em> is typically a multipage document that provides a more complete picture of a particular subject. By default, when a user opens a report in the Power BI interface, the main navigation pane collapses and a Pages pane appears, containing a list of the pages in the report, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig6">Figure 1-6</a>. When you click a tile in a dashboard, the associated report opens to the page containing that tile.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig6">
<img src="images/01fig06.jpg" alt="A Power BI human resources report with the New Hires page selected in the Pages pane on the left, the New Hires page itself in the center, and the Filters pane on the right"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-6</strong> A Power BI report containing four pages of human resources information for a firm</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Reports can contain a great deal of information, so Power BI has controls that can refine the displays that appear. For example, using the Filters pane on the right allows users to configure the display to contain only data conforming to specified categories, such as dates and locations. Designers can incorporate bookmarks into reports that provide alternative views of the same data sets. Consumers can create their own bookmarks also.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h6 class="h6" id="ch1lev4sec3">Using Apps</h6>
<p class="noindent">In Power BI, an <em>app</em> is a collection of dashboards and/or reports that designers can package as a single content element for distribution to consumers, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig7">Figure 1-7</a>. The advantage of app packaging for consumers is that by installing a single app, users can gain access to many dashboards and reports at once, all of which are available in one place.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig7">
<img src="images/01fig07.jpg" alt="An installed sample Power BI app displaying change intelligence information for days, weeks, and specific locations"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-7</strong> A Power BI app containing multiple reports</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="side1">
<p class="side1t"><span class="gray1"><em>Note</em></span> Using Apps</p>
<p class="noindents">The use of apps with Power BI requires a Power BI Pro license. The basic (free) Power BI license provides users with limited consumer capabilities. The (subscription-based) Power BI Pro license, in addition to supporting apps, provides additional capabilities, such as allowing users to share dashboards and subscribe to dashboards and reports. The Power BI Premium license is intended for large organizations and provides dedicated service capacity and huge amounts of storage. As of this writing, the Power BI Pro license is US $9.99 per month and the Power BI Premium license is US $4,995 per month.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"></span>Interacting with Power BI Content</h5>
<p class="noindent">The basic data sharing paradigm of Power BI is for designers to create content and publish it to the Power BI service to share it with consumers. Designers can share content in a variety of ways, including the following:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Publishing</em>—Designers can publish reports and dashboards to the Power BI service and email links to consumers. When the consumer clicks the link and installs the content, it appears in the Shared With Me page in the Power BI interface.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Building apps</em>—Designers can package multiple reports and dashboards into an app and share it with consumers by installing the app in their workspaces, by sending them an installation link, or by posting the app on a website.</p></li>
<li><p class="squareb"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Exporting</em>—Designers and consumers can share Power BI content by printing from a report or dashboard and by exporting data to an Excel or CSV file or an entire report to a PowerPoint or PDF file. Consumers can also store Power BI content on OneDrive for Business.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="side1">
<p class="side1t"><span class="gray1"><em>Note</em></span> Power BI Designers and Consumers</p>
<p class="noindents">One of the innovative aspects of Power BI is that users can easily function as both designers and consumers. Creating dashboards, reports, and apps does not require coding or extensive training, so the process of creating and publishing content is not limited to specialist designers or programmers.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"></span>After consumers have access to published Power BI content, they can interact with it in a variety of ways. For example, consumers can subscribe to dashboards and report pages using the interface shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig8">Figure 1-8</a>, which causes Power BI to send a snapshot of the content to their mailboxes.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig8">
<img src="images/01fig08.jpg" alt="The Power BI dialog box used to create a subscription to a dashboard or report page, with an interface in which the user specifies the email address of the subscriber, the frequency of the snapshots, and the time of day that Power BI should send them"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-8</strong> Power BI subscription interface</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Consumers can also create alerts, using the interface shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig9">Figure 1-9</a>, which cause Power BI to send an email when the value for a selected data point reaches a specified threshold.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig9">
<img src="images/01fig09.jpg" alt="The Power BI dialog box used to create an alert, with an interface in which the user specifies the data point to be monitored and the threshold at which Power BI should generate an alert"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-9</strong> Power BI alert interface</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"></span>Consumers can also exchange thoughts with colleagues by leaving comments in a dashboard or report, using the interface shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig10">Figure 1-10</a>. The comments become part of the element, and other users can read and respond to them.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig10">

</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec3">Using the Power BI Desktop</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"></span>Power BI Desktop is a free Windows application that designers use to create Power BI content, which will be published on the Power BI Service for consumers to use. With an interface similar to that of a Microsoft Office application, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig11">Figure 1-11</a>, the application allows designers to create and publish data visualizations by completing tasks such as the following:</p>
<figure id="ch1fig11">
<img src="images/01fig11.jpg" alt="The Power BI Desktop interface, with columns on the right containing visualizations and data fields for the designer to choose from and a report canvas pane on the left"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-11</strong> The Power BI Desktop interface</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"></span><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Connect to data</em>—Power BI Desktop provides access to more than 200 data sources, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig12">Figure 1-12</a>, which allow designers to obtain data from the local computer; network services, such as SQL databases; and cloud-based services, such as SharePoint and Google Analytics.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure id="ch1fig12">

<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Transform and clean data</em>—Power BI Desktop allows designers to model their data by combining sources, removing unneeded columns, and changing data types, using the Power Query Editor shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig13">Figure 1-13</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig13">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"></span>Act with Power Apps</h4>
<p class="noindent">Power Apps is a collection of apps and services that work with data connectors and data sources to provide a development environment that allows Power Platform users to create their own custom business apps without requiring any coding skills. The data used by the apps can be stored in the Common Data Service that is part of the Power Platform product or in any of the more than 200 external data sources supported by the connectors included in Power Platform.</p>
<p class="indent">Power Apps allows businesses to automate processes that would otherwise be performed on paper. For example, instead of carrying clipboards into the field to document new information or share existing content with colleagues and clients, people can use a tablet or smartphone to record data and save it directly to a database or to display live data from a company source. Apps created with Power Apps can run on any web browser or almost any mobile device using a Power Apps app for Android or iOS.</p>
<p class="indent">While Power Apps is designed to be a simplified application development environment, it also provides an extensible platform that professional developers can use to create more elaborate code-based apps.</p>
<p class="indent">Power Apps supports the creation of three types of apps, as follows:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Canvas—</em>Apps using a development paradigm in which users start with a blank canvas, drag and drop visual elements onto it, and manipulate data using functions like those in Excel. Canvas apps provide developers with complete freedom over the design of the interface.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Model-driven</em>—Apps based on an existing model with a metadata-based architecture, which users customize by connecting to their own data sources and by selecting and configuring components, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig15">Figure 1-15</a>. After the designer selects and models the data, Power Apps generates a user interface that is appropriate for the content.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig15">
<img src="images/01fig15.jpg" alt="The App Designer used to configure model driven apps in Power Apps, consisting of components such as Site Map and Dashboards, which the designer can select from the right pane and configure"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-15</strong> App Designer in Power Apps</p></figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Portal</em>—Apps realized as external facing websites created using selected pages, layouts, and content, which allow users outside of the organization to authenticate and then browse and view company data. Developers can save website projects as templates, which they can use to create new sites.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"></span>As an example, the configuration page for the sample Cost Estimator app shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig16">Figure 1-16</a> allows the designer to select any element in the app (in the left pane) and configure its appearance (in the right pane). The designer can also select the data source for the information displayed on the app page.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig16">
<img src="images/01fig16.jpg" alt="The Power Apps design interface with the app itself displayed in the center pane, the display and data source elements in the left pane, and the properties for the selected element in the right pane"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-16</strong> Sample app in the Power Apps design interface</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">An app can have multiple pages, each of which the designer can configure separately. In this example, shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig17">Figure 1-17</a>, the app is designed for display on a smartphone-sized screen, but other form factors are available.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig17">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec3">Build solutions that use Common Data Service</h4>
<p class="noindent">As noted earlier, Power Platform tools, such as Power BI and Power Apps, can access hundreds of different data sources using the connectors supplied with the product, including local sources, such as Excel workbooks; network sources, such as database servers; and cloud-based sources, such as Microsoft SharePoint Online. After a user establishes a connection to one of these data sources, the connection remains in force as long as the source remains available.</p>
<p class="indent">The Common Data Service, as the name implies, is an underlying data storage solution included in Power Platform and hosted in the cloud by Microsoft Azure, which can function as an alternative to these outside sources by furnishing data to any of the Power Platform tools, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig18">Figure 1-18</a>. The Common Data Service is also the default data store for Dynamics 365 applications, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig18">

<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-18</strong> Underlying services to the Power Platform tools</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The Common Data Service stores data using <em>entities</em>, which are schemas designed to contain specific types of data. Entities consist of <em>attributes</em>, which contain specific types of data values. The Common Data Service includes a large collection of standard entities for frequently used data types, a few of which are shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig19">Figure 1-19</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig19">
<img src="images/01fig19.jpg" alt="The Entities page in Power Apps, displaying the beginning of the list of Common Data Service entities, including Account, Address, and Appointment, along with their names, types, and tags"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-19</strong> Partial listing of entities in the Common Data Service</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The entities provided in the Common Data Service are based on an open standard called the Common Data Model that Microsoft has published as part of its Open Data Initiative, developed in partnership with Adobe and SAP. The model consists of predefined entities, such as application/app, business unit, environment, region, solution, tenant, and user, each of which have attributes, relationships, and metadata. Designers can also create custom entities that are specific to the data types required by a particular organization.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"></span>It is common for users of Power Platform tools to access data from multiple sources and consolidate the data into a single report, app, or flow. As an alternative to maintaining multiple data source connections, it is possible to integrate the data from the sources into Common Data Service, which can then function as a single storehouse for all the necessary local, network, or cloud data, as well as the organization’s Dynamics 365 data. Users can import data from sources as a one-time event or configure Common Data Service to synchronize with the outside data sources at scheduled intervals, ensuring that the information in Common Data Service is always current.</p>
<p class="indent">The Common Data Service also includes a flexible, role-based security system that administrators can use to authorize users with any degree of access they require, down to specific records and fields.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec4">Create flows by using Power Automate</h4>
<p class="noindent">Power Automate is a tool designed to automate processes involving multiple applications that users must otherwise complete manually. Formerly called Microsoft Flow, Power Automate works by creating sequences of events called <em>flows</em>. A flow typically consists of an <em>event</em> (or trigger) that causes the flow processing to begin and one or more <em>actions</em> that the flow performs as a result of the event.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary advantage of Power Automate is that a flow’s events and actions can involve different applications or services. For example, a user can create a flow that causes Power Automate to send a text message to the user’s smartphone when the user receives an email from a specific person.</p>
<p class="indent">Many applications include automation capabilities within their own functions, but they typically cannot automate an action between two or more applications. Power Automate supports <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"></span>hundreds of connectors, triggers, and actions for different applications and services, allowing it to perform complex action sequences that would normally require manual execution. Multistep flows can incorporate actions for different applications, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig20">Figure 1-20</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig20">

<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-20</strong> Events and actions of a multistep flow</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The Power Automate portal includes a large selection of flow templates, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig21">Figure 1-21</a>, which execute common tasks or that can serve as the starting point for customized flows.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig21">

<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-21</strong> Flow templates in the Power Automate portal</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Power Automate supports various types of flows, which you can create from the Power Automate portal or its mobile app, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig22">Figure 1-22</a>.</p>

The interfaces for creating flows provided in the Power Automate portal and in the mobile app are graphical, which means users <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"></span>select input from drop-down lists or by using text boxes. However, Power Automate internally converts flows into code, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig26">Figure 1-26</a>, and users who are so inclined can choose to work with the code directly instead of using the graphical controls.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec5">Use connectors to access services and data</h4>
<p class="noindent">All of the Power Platform tools depend on outside systems for the data they display or process. Those outside systems can be local applications, network servers, or cloud-based services. Power Platform includes hundreds of <em>connectors</em>, which allow the tools to access these outside resources. Wherever the data is located, the user working with the Power Platform tools must have the permissions needed to access the data. In some cases, connector configuration can call for careful management of privileges.</p>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec4">Power BI interoperation</h5>
<p class="noindent">Power BI accesses data on outside systems in order to display it in a different form. Designers of Power BI reports, dashboards, and apps must have the privileges needed to access the required data sources. However, the consumers of Power BI content have no direct access to those data sources. They can only view the reports, dashboards, and apps themselves, as well <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"></span>as work with them by leaving comments. Consumers cannot modify reports, dashboards, and apps in other ways, such as by modifying their appearance.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no way for a Power BI designer or consumer to modify the original data when creating Power BI content or working with the published content. The designer is left with the sole responsibility of determining what data consumers are permitted to view. Power BI includes controls that allow the designer to share the content they create with selected users, who are permitted to view the content they create. Designers can also create workspaces that allow users to function as co-designers of Power BI content.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec5">Power Apps and Power Automate interoperation</h5>
<p class="noindent">Power Apps and Power Automate are both tools that work bidirectionally with data sources, meaning that it is possible for an app or a flow to add or modify source data, as well as read and display it. This complicates the process of accessing and using data sources.</p>
<p class="indent">Power Apps and Power Automate both use connectors to access external applications, services, and data sources. Power Platform includes over 300 public connectors, a few of which are shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig27">Figure 1-27</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig27">
<img src="images/01fig27.jpg" alt="The beginning of the All Connectors list in the Power Automate portal, consisting of 24 tiles representing connectors such as those for Office 365 Outlook, SharePoint, and OneDrive for Business"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-27</strong> Some of the connectors available in Power Automate</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A <em>connector</em> is a proxy wrapper that the tools use to access an API provided by an application or service. Most applications and cloud services include such APIs, and the Power Platform connectors function as proxies—that is, intermediaries between the outside APIs and the internal Power Platform tools. The connector, as a proxy, authenticates to the outside application or service and then provides access to Power Apps and Power Automate (as well as to Azure Logic Apps).</p>
<p class="indent">Each Power Platform connector includes a set of triggers and actions, which are specific operations that designers can use in their apps and flows. Triggers are notifications generated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"></span>by the outside application or service, indicating that a specific event has occurred. For example, the creation of a new item in a specific SharePoint site can activate a trigger in the Power Platform connector for SharePoint, thereby launching a particular flow containing that trigger. There are two types of triggers in Power Platform connectors:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Polling triggers</em>—Check with the outside application or service at regular intervals for new data</p></li>
<li><p class="squareb"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Push triggers</em>—Listen for an event to occur in an outside application or service</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Actions are specific changes made to an outside application or service, usually as a result of a trigger. For example, when a trigger in a Power Automate flow indicates that a new item has been created in a specific SharePoint site, the associated actions in the flow can generate notifications and send them to users by email or text message. Apps and flows can include multiple actions using different connectors, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig28">Figure 1-28</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig28">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec6">Create powerful chatbots by using a guided, no-code graphical interface</h4>
<p class="noindent">Power Virtual Agents is a recent addition to the Power Platform toolkit that allows citizen developers to create customer service chatbots and embed them into websites using a simplified no-code interface. Chatbots, in this instance, are automated, text-based communication interfaces that use branching logic and artificial intelligence to communicate with online clients, ascertain their needs, and in some cases satisfy those needs by triggering flows that perform specific tasks.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23"></span>When a developer creates a virtual agent and adds a default greeting, an authoring canvas appears like the one shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig29">Figure 1-29</a>. By default, the bot’s standard Greeting topic is configured to respond to any one of 52 trigger phrases representing possible initial statements by the client with a standard greeting.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig29">
<img src="images/01fig29.jpg" alt="The Power Virtual Agents portal, with a menu bar on the left, a breakdown of the bot’s greeting on the right, and a preview pane in the center"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-29</strong> The Power Virtual Agents default greeting</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The trigger phrases do not have to match the user’s input exactly. Power Virtual Agents uses a <em>natural language understanding</em> module to match variants of the trigger phrases with an appropriate response. The developer can add more trigger phrases and modify the bot’s greeting as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">To extend the conversation, the developer can create additional topics that ask the user questions, obtain information from the user, and take action based on that information. For example, <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig30">Figure 1-30</a> shows a simple yes or no question and the branching logic that allows the developer to continue the conversation in different ways, depending on the response given.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig30">
<img src="images/01fig30.jpg" alt="The Power Virtual Agents authoring canvas, which is a flowchart containing a yes or no question to be posed by the bot and two branches representing the actions to be taken based on the user’s response"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-30</strong> A Power Virtual Agents topic with branching logic</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Power Virtual Agents can work together with Power Automate, so developers can create flows that perform tasks using information gathered from the user and integrate them into conversations. For example, in the case of a user wanting to check the status of an order, a topic in the bot’s conversation can prompt the user to specify an order number. Then, the bot can pass the order number to a flow that performs a database lookup and supplies information about the order back to the bot, which displays it to the user. For conversations that are unable to provide what the user needs, a topic can pass the user to a live agent.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec7">Describe how Dynamics 365 apps can accelerate delivery of Power Platform business solutions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Dynamics 365 is a series of business applications that is intended to digitally transform organizations by utilizing the data that can be generated by nearly every process essential to productivity. The traditional application model of “forms over data” creates new data as a result of business transactions, whether they are customer relationship interactions or internal resource management exchanges. The interaction comes first, and data is generated as a result of workers filling out digital forms to document the activity.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Digital transformation</em> is a reversal of this process in which the data comes first, data that is now produced by virtually every device and business process. Modern business devices, applications, and services of almost every kind are capable of generating data during their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26"></span>operations and can export it for processing. Virtually all business tools, from environmental devices, such as thermostats and HVAC systems, to industrial machinery, to customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource management (ERP) systems, are capable of generating a continuous stream of data as they operate. The Dynamics 365 applications—in cooperation with the underlying Power Platform tools—can then use this data to track performance and anticipate future incidents and conditions, thus changing a reactive system to a proactive one.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, in the past, a customer experiencing a vital equipment failure would have to call the manufacturer of the equipment and request a service call. The manufacturer’s customer service representative would then create a service request by filling out a form in an application. Only at this point did data begin to be created. The manufacturer’s support team would then start the process by which the service request’s urgency was assessed, the problem investigated, and a service technician dispatched to address the problem. All during this process, the equipment was down, and the customer was experiencing lost productivity.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, after the digital transformation, the customer’s equipment can generate a constant stream of data that is relayed directly to the manufacturer. By monitoring and processing the data, the manufacturer can detect a potential problem before it causes a failure and dispatch a technician on a maintenance call.</p>
<p class="indent">The Dynamics 365 applications and the Power Platform tools provide the analytics needed to utilize this generated data to connect all aspects of the organization, including the human elements—employees and customers—and the business elements—products and operations. This process by which business activities generate data and the Dynamics 365 applications use that data to facilitate further business activities, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig32">Figure 1-32</a>, is called the <em>digital feedback loop</em>, in Microsoft parlance.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig32">

<p class="indent">Microsoft originally designed the Common Data Service as a platform for the Dynamics 365 applications, which use it to store and retrieve their data. Later, Microsoft created the Power Platform tools to function as a low-code/no-code extensibility platform for Dynamics 365 by having it use the same Common Data Service. The data generated by the Dynamics 365 applications is available to all the Power Platform tools, as well as to other applications and services that store data in the Common Data Service.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec8">Describe how Power Platform business solutions can be used by Microsoft 365 apps, including Microsoft Teams</h4>
<p class="noindent">Developers can integrate the content they create using the Power Platform tools into various Microsoft 365 applications and services, including Microsoft Teams. For example, to insert a Power Apps app into Teams, the developer must use the App ID on the app’s Details screen to identify the app to Teams. The App ID is a 128-bit globally unique identifier (GUID), notated as 32 hexadecimal digits, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig33">Figure 1-33</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig33">

<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-33</strong> Details screen of an app in the Power Apps portal</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In Microsoft Teams, the developer must first install the Apps Studio application, then create a new Teams app. Rather than create a new app in Teams, the developer then identifies the Power Apps app to be embedded by specifying its App ID in the Identification section of the App Details screen, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig34">Figure 1-34</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig34">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec9">Describe how Power Platform business solutions can consume Microsoft 365 services</h4>
<p class="noindent">Microsoft 365 is a suite of applications that includes Windows 10, Office 365, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. Power Apps and Power Automate are included with all of the Microsoft 365 products, but only the Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 product includes the Pro version of Power BI. However, all the Power Platform tools are available as separate products and can be added to a Microsoft 365 deployment.</p>
<div class="side3">
<p class="side3t"><img class="inline" src="images/tip.jpg" alt="Image"/> Exam Tip</p>
<p class="noindent3">The original version of Power BI for Office 365 was an add-on product that added visual functionality to existing Excel Power View reports. There was also a Windows 8 app that allowed users to access those reports remotely. This version of Power BI was deprecated as of December 31, 2015 in favor of the new service-based version of Power BI that is part of the Power Platform today. When preparing for the PL-900 exam, be aware that some outdated documentation still exists on the internet that refers to this original Power BI version and not the current one.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">As noted earlier, when Microsoft first began rolling out the Power Platform tools several years ago, they designed them primarily as an extensibility platform for the Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM applications. This was an obvious direction to take because the Power Platform and Dynamics 365 products were all designed to use the Common Data Service. However, Microsoft has announced their intention to expand that extensibility platform to include Microsoft 365 applications and services as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike Dynamics 365, the Microsoft 365 components are not built on the Common Data Service, so they do not have the same shared data connection with the Power Platform tools. However, the Power Platform tools include connectors that allow them to access and use the data generated by the Microsoft 365 applications and services.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, citizen developers at an organization running Microsoft 365 can use Power BI to gather data from branch sites and mobile SharePoint, Exchange, and Teams users as they roam around the facilities or work in the field. They can then create dashboards or reports to display a conglomerated picture of the data from those various sources. Power BI allows the organization to monitor, analyze, and visualize trends in sales, supply, and other aspects of the business, helping them to anticipate needs before they arise.</p>
<p class="indent">Using Power Apps and AI Builder, developers can create applications that use text and image recognition to collect additional data from users as they work with Microsoft 365 applications and services, rather than requiring them to enter data manually on forms-based <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_30"></span>interfaces. For example, mobile users can photograph shelves in stores and warehouses; an app can then scan the photographs, count the number of products on the shelves, and use the data to update a Power BI dashboard with up-to-the-minute information. This additional data can then also be stored in the Common Data Service.</p>
<p class="indent">With Power Automate, citizen developers can create flows that perform time-consuming tasks automatically. In the previous example, the automated shelf-counting app can result in the creation of orders for additional products. When a new order arrives at the supplier’s mailbox, a flow can read the products requested and check the inventory to see whether they are available. If the products are available, the flow can trigger a shipment; if they are not, the flow can branch to a different process that classifies the products as back-ordered and notifies the requestor. Using the connectors supplied with the Power Platform tools, flows can interact with various Microsoft 365 applications and services.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec10">Describe how Power Platform business solutions can consume Microsoft Azure services</h4>
<p class="noindent">Microsoft Azure is Microsoft’s cloud-based architecture for providing hundreds of Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products to customers. The Power Platform tools run on the Azure backbone and are heavily reliant on it for their cloud presence, data storage, and other resources. The Common Data Service stores its data in the Azure cloud, and the portals for the various Power Platform tools are all Azure-based cloud services.</p>
<p class="indent">Because it is cloud based, Microsoft Azure makes the Power Platform tools available to users at any location, using any device. Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents all have mobile apps that allow users to function as both designers and consumers using a smartphone or tablet.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec11">Describe how Power Platform business solutions can consume third-party apps and services</h4>
<p class="noindent">Aside from their compatibility with Microsoft applications and services, the Power Platform tools have connectors that allow them to access data sources from third-party applications and services. Hundreds of public connectors are available that allow users to work with data from various social media and other commercial products. The data sources accessed using connectors can be combined with Common Data Service data to create composite representations in Power BI, Power Apps, and Power Automate.</p>
<p class="indent">For applications or services with representational state transfer (REST) APIs that are not supported by the public connectors included in Power Platform, it is possible to create custom connectors. Administrators can create connectors using definition files based on the OpenAPI or Postman standard, for APIs that support them, or they can build a custom connector from scratch by creating a new definition.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch1lev1sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"></span>Skill 1.3: Understand Power Platform administration and security</h3>
<p class="noindent">As with any other application or service, the Power Platform tools require attention to administration and security to configure them properly and prevent them from being misused.</p>
<p class="indent">Power Platform itself is not a single service; the name refers to a collection of services that organizations can use individually or in combination. The Power Platform tools—Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents, along with their underlying components (Common Data Service, data connectors, and AI Builder)—run as individual services, meaning that they are cloud-based software products that are hosted by Microsoft Azure on a software as a service (SaaS) basis. Each of the four main tools has its own portal, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig35">Figure 1-35</a>, in which users can design and consume content.</p>

<div class="side1">
<p class="side1t"><span class="gray1"><em>Note</em></span> Power BI Desktop</p>
<p class="noindents">The only Power Platform component that is not a cloud-based service is Power BI Desktop, which is a standalone Windows application that designers can use to establish data connections; create reports, dashboards, and apps; and upload them to the Power BI service in the cloud, which makes them available to consumers. Power BI Desktop is not an essential component; designers can create dashboards, reports, and apps in the Power BI Service portal as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32"></span>Because they are Azure services, the Power Platform tools can take advantage of many of the advantages that Azure provides, including high availability due to redundant data centers, localized access using Azure Traffic Manager (ATM), and identity management provided by Azure Active Directory (AAD).</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec12">Describe how Power Platform implements security, including awareness of Common Data Service security roles and Azure Identity Services</h4>
<p class="noindent">Any development environment—even a no-code/low-code one—is subject to abuse by unauthorized users, whether intentional or not. However, because the Power Platform tools are designed for an audience of citizen developers, as well as content consumers, security is a particularly important aspect of their administration. Code-based development environments are not understood by most users, which helps to protect them from casual interference, but they are still subject to deliberate tampering by malicious outsiders. Therefore, the Power Platform tools require security mechanisms like those of any other cloud-based service.</p>
<p class="indent">All of the Power Platform tools rely on the Azure Active Directory identity services for user accounts and licensing. Administrators therefore use the standard Azure tools, such as Microsoft 365 admin center, for user account maintenance and license assignment. Apart from this, the main Power Platform tools operate independently, so they each have their own security architecture. The following sections examine the security considerations for each component.</p>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec6">Power BI security</h5>
<p class="noindent">At its most basic, security in Power BI is a matter of sharing content with other users. Developers control access to their content by sharing dashboards, reports, or apps with specific consumers using the interface shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig36">Figure 1-36</a>. However, for users to access Power BI in the first place, they must first be authenticated and authorized for specific content.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig36">
<img src="images/01fig36.jpg" alt="The Share Dashboard interface in the Power BI portal, in which users specify the email addresses of users who are to be granted access"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-36</strong> Power BI Share Dashboard dialog box</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33"></span>Power BI, as implemented in Microsoft Azure, is a service that consists of two clusters: the Web Front End (WFE) cluster and the Back-End cluster, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig37">Figure 1-37</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig37">
<img src="images/01fig37.jpg" alt="The Power BI security architecture, displaying the two clusters in each implementation: the WFE cluster and the Back-End cluster"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-37</strong> Power BI clusters architecture</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The WFE cluster is responsible for the initial connection by users to the Power BI service and the authentication of the user account, in a process shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig38">Figure 1-38</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig38">
<img src="images/01fig38.jpg" alt="Diagram of the interaction between a user’s browser and the Power BI WFE cluster, including the Azure services needed during the authentication and authorization processes, such as the AAD, the Azure Traffic Manager, and the Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-38</strong> Browser interaction with the Power BI WFE cluster components</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"></span>When a user directs a browser to Power BI by typing a URL or clicking a hyperlink, the following procedures occur:</p>
<ol class="order">
<li><p class="number">The Azure Traffic Manager (ATM) examines the user’s DNS record and directs the browser connection to the WFE cluster in the nearest Microsoft data center.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The WFE cluster directs the user connection to the Microsoft Online Services login page.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The user is asked to authenticate against its account in Azure Active Directory (AAD). When the authentication is successful, the login page directs the connection back to the WFE cluster.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The WFE cluster authorizes the user’s Power BI service subscription with Azure Active Directory and, if the authorization is successful, obtains an AAD security token.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The WFE cluster consults the Power BI Global Service to determine the location of the correct Back-End cluster for the tenant to which the user belongs.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The WFE cluster directs the user connection to the correct Back-End cluster and supplies the user’s browser with the AAD security token, the address of the Back-End cluster obtained from the Global Service, and information about the current session.</p></li>
<li><p class="number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"></span>The user’s browser downloads the common files needed to interact with the Power BI service from the WFE cluster and from the Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN). The browser maintains these files for the duration of the session with the Power BI service.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">After the authentication and authorization processes are completed successfully by the WFE cluster and the browser downloads the necessary files, all subsequent Power BI communication takes place between the browser and the Back-End cluster directly, without further participation of the WFE cluster.</p>
<p class="indent">The Back-End cluster hosts a variety of roles, as well as the data storage media where the Power BI information is stored, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig39">Figure 1-39</a>. The dotted line in the figure represents the division between the modules that are accessible to users via the public internet (on the left) and those that are accessible only indirectly (on the right).</p>
<figure id="ch1fig39">
<img src="images/01fig39.jpg" alt="Power BI Back-End cluster components, including the Gateway, Presentation, Data, Background Job Processing, and Data Movement roles. A vertical dotted line separates the two modules that are accessible to users via the public Internet (Gateway Role and Azure API Management) from those that are not."/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-39</strong> Power BI Back-End cluster components</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The Back-End cluster is responsible for all the Power BI operations for authenticated clients, including the establishment and maintenance of data connections, the creation of the visualizations in dashboards and reports, and the storage of data. Users communicating with the Back-End cluster do so through the Gateway Role.</p>
<p class="indent">The Gateway Role and Azure API Management are the only modules accessible to users through the public internet. These modules accept and manage user connections, authorize users for specific content, and then relay all incoming user requests to the other modules in the cluster as needed. For example, a typical transaction in which a user attempts to access a Power BI dashboard, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig40">Figure 1-40</a>, proceeds as follows:</p>
<figure id="ch1fig40">
<img src="images/01fig40.jpg" alt="A Power BI transaction, with numbered arrows indicating the messages exchanged by the browser and the various Power BI service components, according to the steps in the procedure"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-40</strong> Power BI transaction</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<ol class="order">
<li><p class="number">The user’s browser accesses the Power BI portal and connects to the WFE cluster.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The WFE cluster authenticates the user and authorizes the user’s access to Power BI.</p></li>
<li><p class="number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"></span>The browser connects to the Back-End cluster.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The user generates a request to display a dashboard and sends it to the Gateway Role in the Back-End cluster.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The Gateway Role forwards the request to the Presentation Role, which is responsible for supplying the data needed to create the visualization of the dashboard in the user’s browser.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The Presentation Role sends the requested data to the Gateway Role.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">The Gateway Role forwards the data to the user’s browser, and the browser displays the requested dashboard.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Thus, the Presentation Role (and all of the other non-public roles in the Back-End cluster, including the Data Role, the Background Job Processing Role, and the Data Movement Role) are protected from direct internet access by users, both authorized and unauthorized.</p>
<div class="side1">
<p class="side1t"><span class="gray1"><em>Note</em></span> Power BI Premium</p>
<p class="noindents">Power BI Premium is a subscription level that provides a tenant with a dedicated Back-End service cluster, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig41">Figure 1-41</a>, created on virtual machines located in the same data center as the tenant.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig41">
<img src="images/01fig41.jpg" alt="The cluster architecture of a Power BI Premium subscription, depicting a second, dedicated Back-End cluster containing duplicate roles and data storage elements"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-41</strong> Power BI Premium Back-End cluster architecture</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindents">The Premium cluster contains separate instances of roles found in the Back-End cluster, including the Gateway Role, Azure API Management, Data Role, and Job Processing Role, as well as a separate Azure SQL Database. All communication with the dedicated Premium cluster goes through the shared Back-End cluster, which relays traffic to and from the Gateway Role in the Premium cluster.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37"></span>Designers should also be conscious of the security of the data they use to create dashboards and reports, in addition to the authentication needed to access the Power BI service. When Power BI designers connect to a data source, they typically have to supply credentials for a separate authentication to that source. A dashboard or report that contains the data uses the designer’s credentials to access and update that data. However, when the designer shares the dashboard or report with consumers, those users are not authenticated to the original data sources. Therefore, if the data in the Power BI content is sensitive, the designer is solely responsible for making it accessible to the consumers. As noted earlier in this chapter, Power BI users cannot modify the data used to create dashboards and reports, but in situations where the data is confidential, designers must control who has access to their Power BI content.</p>
<p class="indent">The Back-End cluster contains two forms of data storage: Azure Blob and an Azure SQL Database instance. Azure Blob is a storage solution that Azure uses for large amounts of unstructured data. Power BI uses Azure Blob storage for data that designers import from a source, such as an Excel worksheet. Power BI uses the Azure SQL Database for all other data, including tenant information, workspaces, dashboards and reports, and metadata.</p>
<p class="indent">When designers access data sources, they do so in two possible ways:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Import</em>—Data accessed from a file, such as an Excel worksheet</p></li>
<li><p class="squareb"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>DirectQuery</em>—Data accessed using a reference to an outside source, such as a SharePoint site or a database</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The Data Role in Power BI reads imported data into an Analysis Services in-memory database, in which it is retained for up to one hour, and also stored in Azure Blob storage in encrypted form. Data accessed by DirectQuery is also stored in the Analysis Services database, but only while it is <em>in process</em>—that is, when a procedure occurs that requires access to the data, such as when a user accesses a data set or modifies a report or dashboard, or when a data refresh occurs. The Analysis Services database is unencrypted to allow Power BI to access <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38"></span>the necessary data immediately. When data is <em>at rest</em>, the opposite of in process, it is stored in either in Azure Blob or the Azure SQL Database, and is always encrypted.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec7">Power Apps Security</h5>
<p class="noindent">As with all the Power Platform tools, Power Apps relies on a layered security model that includes the following elements:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Azure Active Directory authentication</em>—Power Apps uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user accounts to control access to its portal and to specific apps. Administrators with appropriate Azure AD credentials can assign Power Apps licenses to users and grant them access to specific apps and security roles. Administrators can also use other Azure tools to regulate access to Power Apps, including conditional access policies and the mobile application protection policies provided by Microsoft Intune.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Power Apps licensing</em>—Developers and consumers must possess a Power Apps license to access the portal, create apps, and run apps.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Environment security roles</em>—Each environment has two built-in administrative security roles, as follows. To assign users to these roles, administrators use the interface shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig42">Figure 1-42</a>, found in the Power Apps admin center.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig42">
<img src="images/01fig42.jpg" alt="The Environment Maker role assignment interface in the Power Apps admin center, in which administrators can specify the names of users to be assigned that role"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-42</strong> Assigning the Environment Maker role</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul class="square1">
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Environment Admin</em>—Can perform all administrative tasks for an environment, including adding users to the Environment Admin and Environment Maker roles, creating Common Data Service databases, and managing all other resources in the environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Environment Maker</em>—Can create resources in the environment, including apps, flows, connections, custom connectors, and gateways, and share apps with other users.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>App sharing</em>—Developers can choose to share apps with other Azure AD users through the interface shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig43">Figure 1-43</a>. By default, the selected sharers are standard users of the app, but the developer can also designate them as co-owners. A co-owner of an app can edit it and share it with others but cannot delete the app or change its owner.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure id="ch1fig43">

</figure>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"></span><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Environment boundaries</em>—An <em>environment</em> is a container for apps, flows, and data that is separate from any other environments in the same tenant. A tenancy has a single environment by default, which is named for the tenant. Administrators can create all their apps and flows in that default environment, or they can choose to create additional environments in that tenant to make separate development spaces. For example, administrators can create separate environments for the various teams or departments in the organization, use them to separate testing and production versions of apps, or use them to create spaces with different security requirements. Each environment is created in a selected geographic region, and all of the environment’s resources are bound to that region. If an administrator chooses to create a Common Data Service database in an environment, that database and the data it contains are only available to apps and flows created in that same environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Connector credentials</em>—The Share dialog box also lists the data connections used by the app. The administrator must see to it that the selected users also have credentials with the permissions required to access the data sources the app needs to function. Power Apps does not provide users with access to data for which they do not already have permissions.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40"></span><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Common Data Service user security roles</em>—A Common Data Service database has three standard security roles, which are sets of permissions that administrators can assign to users and groups and which determine what operations the users can perform on database entities. Administrators can also create custom security roles that contain any combination of the following record-level privileges: create, read, write, delete, append, append to, assign, and share.</p>
<ul class="square1">
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>System Customizer</em>—Provides the users with the create, read, write, and delete permissions for the entities they create and the permission needed to customize the environment.</p></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec8">Power Automate Security</h5>
<p class="noindent">When users create a flow in Power Automate (or an app in Power Apps), they must supply authentication credentials for any connector providing access to a third-party application or service. For example, when creating a flow that is triggered by the addition of an event to a Google calendar, the designer must provide the credentials needed to log on to the Google account containing the calendar to be monitored.</p>
<p class="indent">This fact raises a security concern that the designer must consider. Does the designer want users with whom the flow or app is shared to have access to those credentials? The answer depends on the circumstances, and designers sometimes have multiple options.</p>
<p class="indent">When creating and sharing canvas apps in Power Apps, designers will find that the credentials specified for some connectors are shared with the users receiving the app, whereas other connectors require the app users to specify their own credentials to gain access to a third-party application or service.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of flows created with Power Automate, designers can share flows with other users in the following two ways:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Co-owners</em>—Receive full access to all the connections configured in the flow. Running the flow as is utilizes the existing connection credentials. Co-owners can also modify the flow using the existing credentials or reconfigure connections to use different credentials. However, co-owners cannot use the shared credentials to create their own new flows. Adding a co-owner to a flow causes Power Automate to display a Connections Used warning like the one shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig44">Figure 1-44</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig44">

<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Run-only users</em>—An option only in manually triggered flows. When flow creators add run-only users, they must specify whether the connections in the flow will use the credentials provided by the creator or the run-only users must specify their own credentials, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig45">Figure 1-45</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig45">

<p class="noindent">While the administration of Power BI is relatively simple, because the tool interacts with data sources on a read-only basis, Power Apps and Power Automate have the ability to modify data sources, and administrators must be more careful to regulate the privileges allotted to apps and users.</p>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec9">Managing apps</h5>
<p class="noindent">In the Power Apps portal, the Apps page, shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig46">Figure 1-46</a>, allows you to select an app and edit it, run it, configure its settings, share it with other users, export it, add it to Microsoft Teams, or display its run history.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig46">

<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec10">Managing users</h5>
<p class="noindent">Because the Power Platform tools are all based on Microsoft Azure, they do not need their own identity subsystems; they use Azure Active Directory user accounts to control access to the tool portals and to the resources in each tool.</p>
<p class="indent">To create users and manage user account properties, administrators typically use the Microsoft 365 admin center, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig47">Figure 1-47</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig47">

<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-47</strong> The Active users page in the Microsoft 365 admin center</p></figcaption>

<p class="indent">After creating users, the administrator’s next step in providing them with access to the Power Platform tools is to assign them the appropriate licenses, using the interface generated by the Manage product licenses button, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig48">Figure 1-48</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig48">
<img src="images/01fig48.jpg" alt="The properties page for the user Joanna Yuan with the Licenses and Apps tab selected, displaying the licenses the user possesses for Power Virtual Agents, Microsoft 365, Power Apps, and Power BI"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-48</strong> The Licenses and Apps tab for a selected user</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44"></span>The licenses available for assignment depend on the product subscriptions purchased by the tenant. The Power Platform tools have various levels of licensing, some of which are bundled with other products. For example, the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 products include Power Apps and Power Automate (which may still be called Microsoft Flow). However, the capabilities of those versions are relatively limited, compared with those of the standalone subscriptions, which must be purchased separately.</p>
<p class="indent">After assigning licenses, it might then be necessary for administrators to assign security roles to users. <em>Security roles</em> are associated with business units and are combinations of access levels and permissions that allow users to access data—such as data stored in the Common Data Service—to a specific degree. It is typically users who will be working with model apps for Dynamics 365 who require security roles.</p>
<p class="indent">The interface for the assignment of security roles is found in the Dynamics 365 user management center, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig49">Figure 1-49</a>. This interface is accessible from the Power Apps admin center on the Security tab for a selected environment.</p>

<p class="noindent3">As noted in the Power Apps admin center, the management of security roles has been moved to the Dynamics 365 user management center. As of this writing, Microsoft is in the process of moving various administrative functions between the Power Platform admin center and the Power Apps admin center. When a function is moved, it is typically replaced by a notice specifying the new location. When studying for the PL-900 exam, be conscious of the possible relocation of admin center functions.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec14"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45"></span>Describe environments</h4>
<p class="noindent">When an administrator creates a tenancy in Azure Active Directory for any of the Power Platform tools or other Microsoft products, the software creates a default environment for that tenant. This initial environment is named for the tenant. An <em>environment</em> is a container for the apps and flows created in Power Apps and Power Automate, as well as the data they use. The Power Apps and Power Automate portals both show the current environment they are using in the upper right of the screen, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig50">Figure 1-50</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig50">
<img src="images/01fig50.jpg" alt="The Power Apps portal with the environment indicator highlighted in the upper right of the screen"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-50</strong> The environment indicator in the Power Apps portal</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Because environments are associated with an Azure AD tenant, only the users in that tenancy can access the environment’s resources. The environment is also bound to the tenant’s geographical location.</p>
<p class="indent">Administrators can create only one Common Data Services database in a given environment. The data stored within that database is accessible only to apps and flows created in the same environment.</p>
<p class="indent">However, it is also possible for administrators to create additional environments. The Environments page in the Power Platform admin center, shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig51">Figure 1-51</a>, lists all of the current tenant’s environments.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig51">

<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-51</strong> The Environments page in the Power Platform admin center</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Clicking the +New button opens the New environment dialog, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig52">Figure 1-52</a>, in which the administrator specifies a name, type, and region for the environment. A second page contains options to specify the default language and currency values for the environment. In addition, there is a <em>Create a database for this environment</em> control that causes the tool to create a Common Data Services database along with the environment.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig52">
<img src="images/01fig52.jpg" alt="The New environment dialog box in the Power Platform admin center, which calls for the administrator to specify a name for the environment, select a type and a region, specify a purpose, and choose whether to create a Common Data Service database"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-52</strong> Power Platform New environment dialog box</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46"></span>There are several reasons why administrators might want to create multiple environments in a particular tenancy. They can create separate environments for the teams, departments, or locations in an organization, or they might use them to separate app and flow development or testing projects from those released to production.</p>
<p class="indent">When creating an environment, an administrator must choose one of the following types:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Production</em>—Intended for permanent use and deployment; requires a Power Apps license and one gigabyte of storage space. The default environment created for each Azure AD tenant is a production environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47"></span><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Sandbox</em>—Intended for nonproduction use, such as for development and testing; includes functions to copy the contents of the environment to another environment and reset the environment to its original state by deleting all of its contents and re-creating it.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Trial</em>—Intended for short-term testing; limited to 30 days and one user.</p></li>
<li><p class="squareb"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Developer</em>—Intended for use only by the owner, who must possess a Community Plan license.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">After an administrator has created multiple environments in a tenant, clicking the environment indicator in the Power Apps and Power Automate portals opens an Environments dialog that functions as a selector, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig53">Figure 1-53</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig53">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec15">Describe where to perform specific administrative tasks, including Power Platform admin center and Microsoft 365 admin center</h4>
<p class="noindent">Microsoft Azure services typically have portals called <em>admin centers</em> that provide access to configuration settings, resources specific to the service, support topics, and links to other admin centers. For Microsoft 365 subscribers, the Microsoft 365 admin center is the primary configuration interface, enabling administrators to create and manage user accounts, purchase and manage product subscriptions, and access the other available admin centers, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig54">Figure 1-54</a>.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig54">
<img src="images/01fig54.jpg" alt="The All admin centers page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, containing the first nine entries of a listing of 14 other admin centers"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-54</strong> The All admin centers page in the Microsoft 365 admin center</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The All admin centers list includes the admin centers for Power Automate, Power Apps, and Power BI. However, there is also an admin center for Power Platform, which does not appear on the list. The Power Platform admin center provides administrative access to the tenant’s existing environments, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig55">Figure 1-55</a>, as well as the ability to create new ones.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig55">
<img src="images/01fig55.jpg" alt="The Settings page for a selected environment in the Power Platform admin center, with settings broken down into 10 headings: Product, Business, Users + permissions, Audit and logs, Templates, Email, Integration, Data management, Encryption, and Resources"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-55</strong> Environment Settings page in the Power Platform admin center</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48"></span>The Analytics menu provides real-time statistics for the Power Platform tools, and the Admin centers menu provides links to the Power Automate, Power Apps, and Power BI admin centers, plus the Dynamics 365 admin center, if the organization subscribes to it. Microsoft is gradually migrating other functions from the Power Apps, Power Automate, and Dynamics 365 admin centers to the Power Platform admin center.</p>
<p class="indent">Because Power Apps and Power Automate are often used together, with apps triggering flows as necessary, their admin centers are identical in functionality (as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig56">Figure 1-56</a>), and that functionality is limited by the movement of some controls to other admin centers, such as those for Power Platform and Dynamics 365. The primary tasks possible in these admin centers is the management of app and flow sharing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49"></span>The Power BI Admin portal, shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig57">Figure 1-57</a>, has a menu bar with 12 items, several of which display links to other admin centers. For example, the Users and Audit logs menus both link to the Microsoft 365 admin center, which is where you manage these elements. Other menus provide controls for features only available in the Power BI Premium product or that require the activation of other Microsoft Azure applications.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec16">Describe data loss prevention (DLP) policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Power Platform tools are designed to access data from outside sources and, in some cases, write data back to those sources. Developers can create canvas apps and flows that access multiple data sources with different sensitivity levels. This process is inherently dangerous because the Power Platform content will eventually be deployed to consumers, who might or might not warrant direct access to sensitive data. Power Platform developers and administrators must exercise control over access to the data sources they use, and one method of doing so is to create data loss prevention policies.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50"></span><em>Data loss prevention (DLP)</em> policies are rules, created in the Power Platform admin center, that allow tenant admins and environment admins to classify connectors in three groups, as follows:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Non-business</em>—Intended for connectors that access non-sensitive data. Connectors in this group cannot share data with connectors in the Business group. A newly created DLP rule places all connectors in this category by default.</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Business</em>—Intended for connectors that access sensitive data. Connectors in this group can share data with other connectors only in the Business group; they cannot share data with connectors in the Non-business group.</p></li>
<li><p class="squareb"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Blocked</em>—Intended for connectors that are not to be used in the environment at all.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">To create DLP policies using the wizard in the Power Platform admin center, administrators assign the policy a name and use the interface shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig58">Figure 1-58</a> to move selected connectors from the Non-business group to the Business or Blocked group.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig58">
<img src="images/01fig58.jpg" alt="The Assign connectors page in the New Policy wizard, displaying tabs for the Business, Non-business, and Blocked groups and a part of the list of connectors in the Non-business group"/>
<figcaption><p><strong>FIGURE 1-58</strong> The Assign connectors page in the New Policy wizard</p></figcaption>

<p class="indent">Then, using scope options, administrators can apply the new DLP policy to an entire tenancy or to specific environments within the tenancy.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec17">Describe how the platform supports privacy and accessibility guidelines</h4>
<p class="noindent">In any service or application that stores data that is potentially sensitive, and especially in cloud-based applications and services, there might be statutes and standards to which the organization must comply, whether because of contracted terms, company policies, or governmental requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">Microsoft is aware of these compliance issues and has created a central storehouse for information about them called the <em>Service Trust Portal (STP)</em>. STP is a website that is available to everyone at <a href="http://servicetrust.microsoft.com">servicetrust.microsoft.com</a>, although some parts of the site are restricted to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51"></span>registered users of Microsoft 365 and other products. Among the many resources on the site are links to documents in the following categories:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><p class="squaret"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Audit Reports</em>—Provides independent audit and assessment reports of Microsoft’s cloud services, evaluating their compliance with standards such as those published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Service Organization Controls (SOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Documents &amp; Resources</em>—Consists of a large library of documents, including white papers, FAQs, compliance guides, penetration test reports, Azure security and compliance blueprints, and other data protection resources</p></li>
<li><p class="squarem"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Compliance Manager</em>—A risk assessment tool that assesses and scores an organization’s regulatory compliance, based on multiple published standards</p></li>

<li><p class="squareb"><span class="gray">■</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Trust Center</em>—Links to the Trust Center site, which provides documentation on the means by which Microsoft supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in its cloud services</p></li>
</ul>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec11">Compliance Manager</h5>
<p class="noindent">Compliance Manager is a risk assessment tool that allows an organization to track and record the activities they undertake to achieve compliance with specific certification standards. An assessment of an organization’s compliance posture is based on the capabilities of the Microsoft cloud services and the ways that the organization makes use of them, as compared to an existing standard, regulation, or law.</p>
<p class="indent">The home page for the Compliance Manager tool contains a dashboard that displays tiles representing the assessments of the selected components against different standards, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig59">Figure 1-59</a>. Each tile specifies a cloud service and the specific standard to which it is being compared. The results of the comparison are stated as a numerical score.</p>
<figure id="ch1fig59">

<h5 class="h5" id="ch1lev3sec12">Auditing</h5>
<p class="noindent">Power Platform also supports auditing, which is another way of monitoring compliance with data access regulations. Auditing captures instances of specific activities and saves them to a log file, which administrators can review to monitor data access by specific users, modifications of security roles, changes made to entities and fields, changes made to sharing privileges, and the time and place of updates.</p>
<p class="indent">To allow auditing and access auditing logs, an administrator expands the Audit and logs heading on an environment’s Settings page in the Power Platform admin center. Selecting Audit settings opens the Auditing tab on the System Settings page of the Dynamics 365 admin center, as shown in <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1fig61">Figure 1-61</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch1lev1sec5">Thought experiment</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this thought experiment, demonstrate your skills and knowledge of the topics covered in this chapter. You can find the answer to this thought experiment in the next section.</p>
<p class="indent">Ralph is the sole IT administrator for Wingtip Toys, which has six offices in different cities. The offices have always operated independently, with each one maintaining its own financial information using Excel workbooks. The company executives are concerned about the security of their financial data. This is one of the reasons each of the six offices maintains its own Excel workbooks. Because of this arrangement, creating a picture of the company’s overall financial health has always been a problem. Each year, an outside accounting firm compiles the data from the six offices into a comprehensive report, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and that generates a financial picture that is largely out of date.</p>
<p class="indent">Ralph has been asked to devise a solution that will provide the company executives with an overall financial picture of the entire company that is updated on a continual basis. Having seen materials on the Power BI service, Ralph thinks that it might help him to accomplish his task.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on Ralph’s requirements and your knowledge of the Power BI service, which of the following are true statements?</p>
<ol class="ordern">
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="ch1qa1" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#rch1qa1"><span class="grayn">1.</span></a> Power BI is capable of accessing data from six different Excel workbooks at different locations and combining the data into a single financial report display that is accessible from any Internet device.</p></li>
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="ch1qa2" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#rch1qa2"><span class="grayn">2.</span></a> Power BI can access the Excel data from the six sites without any possible danger of the original files being modified or damaged.</p></li>
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="ch1qa3" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#rch1qa3"><span class="grayn">3.</span></a> Ralph can use Power BI Desktop to create new reports on his Android smartphone and publish them to the Power BI service.</p></li>
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="ch1qa4" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#rch1qa4"><span class="grayn">4.</span></a> Ralph must manually update the Power BI reports he creates to make sure that the data displayed is current.</p></li>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch1lev1sec6">Thought experiment answers</h3>
<p class="noindent">This section contains the solution to the thought experiment. Each answer explains why the answer choice is correct.</p>
<ol class="ordern">
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="rch1qa1" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1qa1"><span class="grayn">1.</span></a> True. Power BI provides access to more than 200 data sources that allow designers to obtain data from Excel workbooks on local network computers, as well as network services, such as SQL databases and cloud-based services, such as SharePoint and Google Analytics.</p></li>
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="rch1qa2" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1qa2"><span class="grayn">2.</span></a> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55"></span>True. Power BI consists of services, applications, and connectors that can access data from multiple sources and display it in various ways, but Power BI does not manipulate or modify the data in any way. Whether a user is a designer using Power BI Desktop to model data or a consumer using the Power BI reading view to display the published data, nothing that either type of user does can possibly modify or delete the underlying data itself.</p></li>
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="rch1qa3" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1qa3"><span class="grayn">3.</span></a> False. Power BI Desktop is a free Windows application that designers can use to create Power BI content and publish it on the Power BI Service for consumers to use. It cannot run on an Android smartphone.</p></li>
<li><p class="numbern"><a id="rch1qa4" href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch1qa4"><span class="grayn">4.</span></a> False. After a designer connects to a data source, creates Power BI content, and publishes it to the service, the connection to the source remains in place and the published data is updated automatically as the source data changes. This allows users to track information on a continual basis.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56"></span></p></li>
